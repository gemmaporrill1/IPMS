# Gemma Porrill – Python/Database Project Documentation

## Design
I have designed this project to be from the admin point of view, not the customer. This IPMS is for a car insurance branch and includes a home dashboard, customer management, policy management and finally the claims calculator. The main feature is the claim calculator. I have made it so it calculates how long the customer has been with the policy and multiply their monthly payments by that length and then plus the min payout. Once the estimated claim amount is calculated, I have added a reject or accept button where the user can choose what status the estimated claim will have. I have used Sanlam colours and styling to build the CSS and html while keeping in mind to make it responsive. Overall, this app is a springboard for a bigger concept in where you take pre-inputted values as calculation variables and immediately have an estimated output, therefore making insurance calculations easier.

## Development Process
I started off with a mixture of focusing on back and front end. I did not have a set approach such as doing all the backend and then designing the front end. My strong suit is front end so I would do one endpoint and then do the html and CSS for it and go along like that until all the pages where in place. I started with the easier endpoints such as adding customer and adding policy which led up to the claim calculator. I also used my local database to do all testing as Azure credits would be run down quickly. Overall, the development process has been suited to what I am comfortable with.

## Problems faced
1.	The claims calculator was giving me an issue because I was unsure which variables, I should use in order to give an estimate claim amount. 
2.	Routing/rerouting was an issue as well. We didn’t go into much detail about how to reroute with a button or when the form is submitted how to get back to the page.
3.	Adding in all the extras as we learnt more every day.

## Solutions implemented
1.	I simplified the calculation and now it is standardised between all customers and policies.
2.	A lot of research and trial and error with routing to get where I need to be.
3.	Just persevering and doing a little bit every day with the improvements we learnt that day.
